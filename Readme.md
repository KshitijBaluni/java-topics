In Java, methods are used for code organization and reusability. This section covers method declaration, parameters, return types, method overloading, and method overriding. You will also learn about static methods and instance methods.

### Constructors in Java

Constructors are special methods

used for initializing objects. This section explains how to define constructors, use constructor chaining, and apply constructor overloading. It also covers the concept of default constructors.

### Modifiers in Java

Java provides various modifiers to control the access, behavior, and visibility of classes, methods, and variables. This section covers access modifiers (public, private, protected), non-access modifiers (final, static, abstract), and other modifiers like synchronized and transient.

### Static Keywords

The static keyword in Java is used to create class-level variables and methods. This section explains static variables, static methods, static blocks, and their usage. You will also learn about the concept of static imports.

### Final Keywords

The final keyword is used to make entities (classes, methods, variables) immutable or restrict their behavior. This section covers final classes, final methods, final variables, and their significance in Java programming.

### Inner Class in Java

Java supports the concept of inner classes, which are classes defined within other classes. This section explains the different types of inner classes (static nested classes, non-static nested classes, local classes, anonymous classes) and their usage.

### Super & This Keyword

The super and this keywords are used to refer to the superclass and current instance, respectively. This section covers their usage in constructors, method overriding, and accessing superclass members. You will also learn about method hiding.

### OOPS Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a key paradigm in Java. This section provides an overview of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing modular and maintainable code.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and hiding the internal details from external access. This section explains encapsulation principles, access modifiers, and the benefits of encapsulated code.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. This section covers inheritance syntax, types of inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical), method overriding, and the concept of superclasses and subclasses.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms. This section explains polymorphic behavior in Java through method overriding and method overloading. You will learn how to write code that can handle different object types.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into manageable components. This section covers abstract classes, abstract methods, interfaces, and their role in achieving abstraction in Java.

### Garbage Collection

Java's garbage collector automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable. This section explains garbage collection concepts, the finalize() method, and techniques for efficient memory management.

### Streams API

The Streams API in Java provides a powerful and functional approach to process collections of data. This section covers stream creation, intermediate and terminal operations, and how to leverage streams for efficient data manipulation.

Exceptions are used to handle abnormal situations and prevent program crashes. This section explains exception handling in Java, including try-catch blocks, checked and unchecked exceptions, exception propagation, and best practices.

### Java Annotation

Annotations provide metadata about program elements at compile-time or runtime. This section covers the different types of annotations (marker, single-value, and full

-value), creating custom annotations, and using built-in annotations.

### Reflection in Java

Reflection allows programmatic access to a class's properties, methods, and constructors at runtime. This section covers the java.lang.reflect package, accessing class metadata, and dynamically invoking methods.

### Java Array

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. This section covers array declaration, initialization, accessing array elements, multi-dimensional arrays, and common array operations.
